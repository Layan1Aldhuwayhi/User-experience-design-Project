# User experience design 
 This project provides an introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and an overview of software architectures used in modern interfaces. The project will describe and apply theoretical concepts for analyzing observed problems in interfaces, models and frameworks from the field. The interaction design process, rules and principles that support the usability will be described and applied theoretically and in practice via interaction prototypes. A variety of user interface evaluation techniques (e.g. GOMS. heuristic evaluation, User- Centered Design and contextual design techniques) in the field of HCI will be covered and applied according to usability and accessibility standards. and will also cover principles of universal design.
